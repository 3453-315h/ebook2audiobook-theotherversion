# Roadmap

## Short-term Goals
- [ ] **Docker Support**: Finalize and verify the Docker build process for consistent deployment across platforms.
- [ ] **GPU Optimization**: Improve GPU detection and utilization, particularly for NVIDIA GPUs (resolving detection issues).
- [ ] **Documentation**: Ensure all documentation (README, Wiki) is up-to-date with the latest installation and usage instructions.

## Medium-term Goals
- [ ] **Language Support**: Expand support for additional languages and dialects (aiming for 1100+).
- [ ] **Model Fine-tuning**: Simplify the process for users to fine-tune XTTSv2 models with their own data.
- [ ] **User Interface**: Enhance the Gradio Web GUI for better usability and responsiveness.
- [ ] **Performance**: Optimize CPU inference speed for users without dedicated GPUs (exploring lighter models or optimizations).

## Long-term Goals
- [ ] **Real-time Conversion**: Achieve near real-time conversion speeds for supported hardware.
- [ ] **Mobile Support**: Investigate possibilities for a mobile-friendly version or companion app.
- [ ] **Community Integration**: Better integrate community-contributed voices and models directly into the application.

## "Help Wanted"
- [ ] **Translation**: Native speakers needed to verify and improve pronunciation for supported languages.
- [ ] **Testing**: Users to report "truncated audio" issues to help refine sentence splitting logic.
- [ ] **Development**: Contributions to the core codebase, particularly for "What we need help with" items (see Issue #32).
